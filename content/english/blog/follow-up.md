# Project Specifications Take Shape in Second EDP Meeting

We're making significant progress in our collaboration with EDP! On March 14th, we reconvened with engineer André Coelho to dive deeper into the specific requirements and technical implementation of our automated drone inspection system.

## Targeting Specific Use Cases

This meeting allowed us to identify precise scenarios where our technology can provide maximum value. We discussed:

- High-priority inspection points along transmission lines
- Seasonal inspection requirements and weather considerations
- Integration possibilities with EDP's existing maintenance workflows

## Software Implementation Details

A substantial portion of our discussion focused on critical software features that will enhance both efficiency and effectiveness:

- Autonomous navigation capabilities needed for complex flight paths
- Image recognition requirements for identifying potential issues
- Data management and reporting functionalities to streamline the inspection process

## Hardware Decisions

Following up on insights from our previous consultation with drone specialist Diogo Henrique, we explored the reasoning behind using quadcopter drones rather than fixed-wing aircraft for this application. With André's input, we've now defined the specific drone model we'll be using during the testing phase.

## Next Steps: Moving Toward Testing

With both the software requirements and hardware specifications aligned, we're now preparing to enter the testing phase of our project. The EDP team has provided valuable parameters that will help us create realistic test scenarios.

We're excited about the momentum this project is gaining and look forward to sharing results from our initial testing soon!
