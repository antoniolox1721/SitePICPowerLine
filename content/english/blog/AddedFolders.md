# Introducing Structure-Based Data Organization

Our drone inspection application just got a major upgrade to its data management system! **Luís Almeida** has implemented a sophisticated folder organization system that automatically categorizes inspection data by structure.

## Organized by Structure, Optimized for Analysis

The new system creates a hierarchical folder structure that makes finding and analyzing inspection data more intuitive than ever:
/Inspections
/Structure_S1
/Photo_P1_20250518
/Photo_P2_20250518
...
/Structure_S2
/Photo_P1_20250518
...

ach structure gets its own dedicated folder, with subfolders for each photo position containing the timestamped images and associated metadata.

## Benefits for Field Teams

This organizational approach offers several immediate benefits:

- **Faster access** to specific structure data
- **Streamlined comparison** between different inspection dates
- **Simplified reporting** for specific structures
- **Reduced errors** in data association
- **Improved handoff** between field and analysis teams

## Technical Details

The system works by parsing the structure and photo position data from the CSV mission files and using this information to create a consistent naming and folder structure. The implementation hooks into the `PhotoStorageManager` class to ensure all newly captured photos are automatically filed in the correct location.

## Future Enhancements

In future updates, we plan to add automatic synchronization with cloud storage systems and implement a search function that can quickly locate specific structures or photo positions across multiple inspection dates.

We're confident this new organizational system will make a significant difference in the efficiency of field operations and subsequent analysis work. Great job, Luís!
