# IST Collaboration Confirmed: Launching Drone Testing for Automation

We're thrilled to share a major step forward in our project! On October 21st, our team met with Professor Rita Cunha from Instituto Superior Técnico to outline how IST could actively support the development and testing of our drone automation system.

## Key Outcomes of the Meeting

The most exciting development? **We’ve secured access to a DJI Mavic 2 drone, along with permission to use the indoor test lab at Taguspark.**

This means our team can begin direct integration and testing of our application using real hardware in a controlled environment — a critical milestone for validating and refining our automation algorithms.

## What's Next

With the drone and test space secured, we're now moving into the practical phase of development. Over the coming weeks, we’ll begin running flight tests and evaluating how our system performs under real-world conditions.

This collaboration with IST represents a huge leap toward making our autonomous drone inspection platform a reality. We’re grateful for the support and excited to see what we can achieve.

Stay tuned for more progress updates from the lab!
