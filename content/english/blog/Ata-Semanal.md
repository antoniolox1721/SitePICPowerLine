# Organizing for Success: Our Implementation Roadmap

Following our consultation with Prof. Caldas Oliveira, our team conducted an intensive planning session to establish clear roles, responsibilities, and a detailed weekly implementation schedule. This organizational framework will guide our development efforts over the next eight weeks as we build our PowerLine Drone inspection system.

## Team Roles and Core Responsibilities

Each team member has been assigned specific areas of responsibility that align with their technical strengths and expertise:

### António Alves - Advanced UI Development and Analysis
- Telemetry dashboard implementation
- Real-time flight data visualization
- Notification and alert systems
- Basic image analysis integration

### Luís Almeida - Waypoints and Missions
- Complete waypoint system implementation
- Automated inspection pattern development
- Mission planning functionality
- Waypoint revisiting capabilities

### João Henriques - Camera and Multimedia Management
- Drone camera control systems
- Photo and video capture functionality
- Real-time video feed implementation
- Multimedia management (viewing, downloading)

### Miguel Baia - Basic Flight Control
- Drone connectivity and communication
- Drone status monitoring systems
- Basic flight controls (takeoff, landing)
- Basic telemetry data processing

### Henrique Martins - Basic User Interface
- Application layout design
- UI component development
- Color scheme implementation
- Mockup implementation

### Ricardo Nobre - Testing and Documentation
- Test plan creation and management
- Test execution and reporting
- Technical and user documentation
- Feedback collection and integration

## Weekly Implementation Schedule

We've developed a detailed week-by-week implementation plan to ensure steady progress toward our June 2nd deadline:

### Week 1 (April 8-14): Setup and Basic Functionality
- **António**: Develop initial UI structure and main navigation system
- **Luís**: Implement basic waypoint system and point creation interface
- **João**: Implement camera connection and basic video feed
- **Miguel**: Configure drone connection and basic telemetry
- **Henrique**: Create basic application layout and simple UI components
- **Ricardo**: Create testing structure and initial documentation
- **Deliverable**: Basic application with drone connection, main navigation, and video feed

### Week 2 (April 15-21): Missions and Image Capture
- **António**: Develop advanced telemetry dashboard and notification system
- **Luís**: Implement waypoint mission execution and monitoring
- **João**: Add photo/video capture at waypoints and basic viewing
- **Miguel**: Implement flight controls and drone status monitoring
- **Henrique**: Develop UI for flight control and status visualization
- **Ricardo**: Test basic functionality and document progress
- **Deliverable**: Functional waypoint system, image capture, and telemetry dashboard

### Week 3 (April 22-28): Advanced Features
- **António**: Implement 3D mission viewer and basic image analysis
- **Luís**: Add automated inspection patterns and waypoint revisiting functionality
- **João**: Develop advanced multimedia management and metadata
- **Miguel**: Add safety alerts and flight parameter optimization
- **Henrique**: Enhance interface with color scheme and visual feedback
- **Ricardo**: Conduct integration testing and prepare user documentation
- **Deliverable**: Complete inspection system, basic image analysis, and refined interface

### Week 4-8: Refinement and Completion

Our plan continues with detailed tasks for weeks 4 through 8, focusing on integration, testing, refinement, and final delivery preparation. Each week builds on the previous accomplishments, with increasing emphasis on system optimization and user experience as we approach the final deadline.

## Collaboration Framework

To ensure effective collaboration across team members, we've established:

- **Daily Stand-ups**: Brief 15-minute morning meetings to discuss progress and blockers
- **Weekly Reviews**: End-of-week sessions to evaluate progress against our timeline
- **Shared Documentation**: Centralized documentation in our project repository
- **Development Branches**: Dedicated branches for each major feature area
- **Integration Schedule**: Specific points when individual components will be merged

## Priority Framework

We've also established a prioritization framework for feature implementation:

1. **Must-Have**: Core functionality required for the system to function (drone control, basic waypoints, image capture)
2. **Should-Have**: Features that provide significant value but aren't critical (automated patterns, multimedia management)
3. **Nice-to-Have**: Features that enhance the system but could be deprioritized if time constraints arise (advanced visualization, complex analysis)

This framework will guide our decision-making if we encounter unexpected challenges during implementation.

## Next Steps

With our roles and timeline clearly established, we've already begun implementation of our Week 1 deliverables. Our first integration point will be this Friday, where we'll combine the basic drone connectivity, UI framework, and camera control components to verify that our foundation is solid.

We're confident that this structured approach, combined with the technical guidance from Prof. Caldas Oliveira, positions us well to deliver an effective solution for autonomous drone inspection of high-tension power lines by our June 2nd deadline.
