# Milestone Reached: Basic Flight Code Finalized

We’ve officially wrapped up development of the **basic drone flight controls** — and we're thrilled to share that the project is entering a new phase. On April 18th, our team concluded implementation of takeoff, hover, movement, and landing routines.

## Next Step: Waypoint Mission Development

With the foundational logic in place, we’re now shifting our attention to **autonomous waypoint-based missions**. This functionality will allow the drone to execute pre-planned paths without manual assistance, unlocking real inspection capabilities at scale.

Using the DJI Mobile SDK’s mission APIs, we’ll define precise sequences of coordinates, altitudes, and actions — giving our system full control over where and how the drone flies.

## What's Coming

Over the next few weeks, we’ll begin implementing and testing waypoint logic, focusing first on simple missions before scaling up to complex inspection scenarios.

This marks a crucial step toward true drone automation. We’re excited to see our work evolve from manual control to fully autonomous operations.

More soon as our drone starts thinking for itself!
