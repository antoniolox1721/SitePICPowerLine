# Enhanced Photo Gallery for Drone Inspections

We're excited to announce a significant upgrade to our drone inspection platform! **António Alves** has developed and implemented a comprehensive photo gallery system that transforms how inspection data is stored, viewed, and managed.

## Key Features of the New Photo Gallery

The newly integrated photo gallery includes:

- **Full-screen preview** of inspection photos with metadata
- **Thumbnail grid view** for quick browsing of captured images
- **Filtering and sorting** capabilities by date, structure ID, and photo position
- **Share functionality** for exporting images to other applications
- **Delete functionality** for managing storage space

## Real-Time Photo Review During Missions

One of the most powerful aspects of this new feature is the ability to review photos in real-time during a mission. When the drone captures an image of a structure, the mission automatically pauses, allowing operators to:

1. Review the photo quality
2. Accept or reject the image
3. Retake if necessary
4. Continue the mission with confidence

This immediate feedback loop ensures that every inspection captures high-quality, usable data the first time.

## Technical Implementation

The system leverages a custom `PhotoStorageManager` class that handles all aspects of image storage and retrieval. Photos are stored with comprehensive metadata including:

- Structure ID
- Photo position ID
- Timestamp
- GPS coordinates
- Camera settings

## What's Next

In upcoming updates, we plan to enhance the gallery with annotation capabilities and automated defect detection algorithms to further streamline the inspection process.

The new photo gallery system represents a significant step forward in making our drone inspection platform more user-friendly and effective for field operations. Special thanks to António Alves for leading this critical development!
