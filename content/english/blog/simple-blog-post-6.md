# EDP Partnership Begins: Revolutionizing Power Line Inspections

We're excited to announce the beginning of a promising collaboration with EDP! On October 21st, our team sat down with EDP engineer André Coelho to discuss how we can tackle some of the company's most pressing challenges.

## Key Insights from Our Meeting

During our productive discussion, we identified several opportunities where our technology could make a significant impact. The standout revelation? **The potential to make power line inspections faster and more cost-effective through automated drone operations.**

Currently, EDP relies on professional drone pilots who aren't full-time employees, creating both scheduling constraints and additional expenses. Our proposed solution would automate drone flight paths, eliminating the need for specialized pilots while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs.

## What's Next

We've established a collaborative framework with EDP to develop the optimal solution. Our team will focus on creating an automated drone system specifically tailored for high-tension power line inspection.

This partnership represents an exciting opportunity to apply cutting-edge drone technology to solve real-world infrastructure challenges. We look forward to working closely with EDP's engineering team to bring this vision to life.

Stay tuned for more updates as this project develops!
