# Drone Technology Deep Dive with Industry Expert

This week, our team had the valuable opportunity to meet with Diogo Henrique, a recognized expert in drone technology and operations. This consultation provided crucial insights that will shape our development approach for the EDP power line inspection project.

## Current Landscape & Innovation Opportunities

Diogo walked us through the existing drone capabilities in the market, helping us understand:

- The current state of autonomous flight systems
- Software platforms dominating the industry
- Specific sectors where innovation gaps exist

This reality check was invaluable in helping us identify where our solution can truly bring something new to the table rather than reinventing existing technologies.

## LIDAR Technology in Drone Operations

A significant portion of our discussion focused on LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology and its applications in inspection operations. Diogo provided a comprehensive explanation of how this technology:

- Creates precise 3D mappings of power lines and surrounding environments
- Detects anomalies that might not be visible to traditional cameras
- Functions effectively in various weather and lighting conditions

## Looking Forward

This consultation has considerably expanded our technical understanding and helped us narrow our innovation focus. We're now better equipped to develop a solution that leverages the best of current technology while addressing genuine gaps in the power line inspection process.

Our next steps will involve integrating these insights into our development roadmap before our follow-up meeting with EDP.
