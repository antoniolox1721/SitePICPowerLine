# Pushing Forward: SDK & Development Environment Chosen During Exam Season

Even with exams around the corner, our team made time to keep the project moving. On October 28th, we held a productive team meeting to define the technical foundation for our drone automation system.

## Key Decision Made

After considering our options, we agreed to move forward with the **DJI Mobile SDK** and **Android Studio** as the primary tools for development. This combination allows us to begin implementing and testing the basic flight plans needed for autonomous drone operation.

## Why It Matters

With these tools, we can now develop the code to manage key actions like takeoff, hovering, flight path execution, and landing. The Mobile SDK provides direct access to drone controls, while Android Studio gives us the flexibility to build a custom app interface tailored to our mission.

## What's Next

We’ll begin developing and testing our initial flight logic in the coming days — an exciting step, especially given the balancing act with our academic responsibilities.

We’re proud of the dedication shown by the team, and this meeting reflects our commitment to pushing the project forward, even during the busiest times.

Stay tuned as we start turning our plans into code!
