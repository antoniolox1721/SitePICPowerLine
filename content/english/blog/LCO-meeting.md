# Shaping Our Approach: Guidance from Prof. Luis Caldas Oliveira

This week, our team had the privilege of meeting with our project guide, Prof. Luis Caldas Oliveira, to discuss our approach to developing the PowerLine Drone inspection system. His extensive expertise in both drone technology and power infrastructure provided invaluable direction as we prepare to enter the implementation phase.

## Implementation Strategy

One of the most significant outcomes of our meeting was the development of a phased implementation strategy. Prof. Caldas Oliveira helped us prioritize features into three distinct phases:

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Core Functionality
- Functional drone connectivity
- Basic waypoint system
- Image capture capabilities
- Navigable user interface

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5): Enhanced Features
- Advanced telemetry visualization
- Waypoint revisiting functionality
- Multimedia management
- Automated inspection patterns

### Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8): Advanced Capabilities
- Image analysis implementation
- Advanced 3D visualization
- Interface optimizations
- Final reporting and documentation

This structured approach ensures we focus on establishing a solid foundation before adding more complex features.

## Technical Considerations

Prof. Caldas Oliveira provided specific technical guidance on several key aspects:

- **Drone Platform Selection**: Confirmed our choice of the DJI Mavic 2 as appropriate for the project scope, highlighting its stability and camera capabilities
- **Flight Control Parameters**: Recommended specific settings for maintaining stable flight around power infrastructure
- **Image Resolution Requirements**: Advised on minimum resolution requirements for effective anomaly detection
- **Safety Protocols**: Outlined essential failsafe mechanisms that must be implemented

His insights on the particular challenges of drone operation near high-voltage infrastructure were especially valuable, as this represents one of the most critical safety considerations for our system.

## Development Principles

Beyond specific technical guidance, Prof. Caldas Oliveira emphasized several principles that should guide our development process:

1. **Prioritize reliability over feature breadth** - A system that performs core functions reliably is more valuable than one with many unreliable features
2. **Implement early integration testing** - Begin testing integration points between components as early as Week 3
3. **Create realistic test conditions** - Test the system in conditions that simulate actual deployment scenarios
4. **Document throughout the process** - Record design decisions and implementation details continuously, not just at the end

## Ongoing Mentorship

Prof. Caldas Oliveira has committed to reviewing our progress at the completion of each phase, providing feedback and guidance to ensure we remain on track. This structured oversight will be invaluable in maintaining our development momentum while addressing any technical challenges that arise.

We've scheduled our next review session for April 22nd, which will coincide with the completion of our Phase 1 implementation.

The strategic direction and technical insights provided by Prof. Caldas Oliveira have significantly strengthened our approach to this project. With this guidance, we're confident in our ability to deliver a robust solution for autonomous drone inspection of high-tension power lines.
